C64:
Apple II:
Starring:
	Three pages page flipping.  Hires colors subset of Lores so
	can replicate a blocky color image.  Could in theory animate this
	at 60Hz.  Also could flip between 4 pages, but need the 8k of
	HGR page2.

	For cycle-counting timing, jmp one into a bit $C055 instruction
	which is EOR $C0,X (4 cycles)

	Note, discover that the LORES and HIRES pages aren't exact matches
	for each other, even when using same color.  Half-pixel off?

E-mail:
	Half screen text, half 40x96 lores.
	Text is also interlaced top/bottom to create new chars (including
	some lowercase) on Apple II+ and before w/o lower case.
	Trouble as the built-in font is offset a frame on II vs IIe?
	Also annoyance, my GR compressor uses Grey2 (color $a) as encoding,
	which means can't use a GR image to hold plain black spaces (char $a0)
