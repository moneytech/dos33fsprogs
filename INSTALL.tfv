Sorry for how convoluted these are.

To install TFV on Linux on Debian (including Raspberry Pi w Raspbian)

First install some pre-requisites:
	sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev gcc make git

Then run the following commands:
	git clone https://github.com/deater/dos33fsprogs.git
	cd dos33fsprogs
	make
	cd gr-sim
	make
	cd tfv
	./tfv
