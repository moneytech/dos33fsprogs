TODO Before release:
====================
	?
	

KNOWN BUGS:
===========
+ Kicking slugs will kill slugs behind you too, need to check DIRECTION

+ Ledge in L4 it's possible to end up standing off edge of cliff

+ ootw: pool monster grabs you a edge of pool (glitch)
+ intro: there's still a bit of a pause when the elevator door finishes opening
+ running: Missing one running frame (?)
+ L2 vent -- we fall behind the vent
  No easy way to fix that unless we split if off from
  the friend drawing code, or change the Z order of the friend


MISSING SPRITES:
================
  + physicist swimming
  + beast tripping
  + alien running
  + friend running
  + alien punching animation


BEHAVIOR DIFFERENCES:
=====================

+ General differences
	* physicist behavior:
		- should be separate sprites for left/right
		  (not one flipped sprite)
		- actual game has much more variety of movement positions
		- if have gun, should be visible when running.  Hard to do
		  this in a way that looks right

	* alien guard behavior:
		- will punch you if you get too close
		- become alert if they hear an explosion
		- l4, if you draw gun (but not fire) guard won't shoot you,
		  but instead will yell at you a bit
		- l2 first battle has very elaborate behavior with an
			ofscreen battle and your friend running back,
			and eventually more waves of aliens will come
			after you
		- l2/room5: alien appears to left of door.  Works on panel to
			unlock it, comes in and bothers friend after
			we call down.
			also I think if you wait long enough more aliens
			appear if you try to go left.
		- should be able to crouch/shoot
		- should be able to blast/shield

	* gun behavior:
		- doors/walls should explode outward away from blast
		  *unless* there is another door/wall behind it
		- laser should show sparks when hits shields/walls
		- shield cannot be placed if room/floor wrong
		- shield collapse animation if blown up with blast

	* door behavior:
		- blasted doors, the remains appear partly in front


+ Level/Checkpoint 1

	* underwater:
		- underwater in game there is a subtle water-motion effect
		- bubble motion is fancier in real thing

	* by the pool:
		- get out of water, you face forward unless key pressed
		  (we don't have a forward sprite as it looks weird)
		- arrival, the beast movement seems to depend on your xpos?
		- small things like birds flying are not implemented

	* caverns:
		- beast on hill and 2nd screen -- complex, only appears if
		  you happen to leave same time beast does?  then movement
		  depends on xposition?
		- sometimes falling rocks can follow you to next screen

	* rope:
		- earthquake should happen while on rope

	* beast:
		- beast can/should trip and fall if it gets too close but
			then you pull away
		- beast should climb hill in rope room better
		- beast has shadow when standing

	* slugs:
		- slugs possibly can fall due to earthquake?
		- they should explode away from kick
			currently always explode right

+ Level/Checkpoint 2

	* cage room:
		- in game, after some time the guard calms down

	* jail:
		- in actual game, foreground animations can continue
		  to next screen?
		- flashes on wall from gunfire in neighboring room

	* level end:
		- you should fall/scroll halfway down the shaft, then roll
		  a bit before falling into L3

	* Elevator:
		- should be able to change elevator direction mid-floor
		- Elevator should shoot sparks every 20 frames or so

	* View:
		- does music play when looking at city?
		  Not original Amiga version

+ Level/Checkpoint #3:
	* Actual game shakes the camera when you hit the ground after falling

+ Level/Checkpoint #4:
	* Implement guard (shooting, taunting)

+ Level/Checkpoint #5
	* Allow falling into first pit

+ Level/Checkpoint #15
	* Bath: shooting guard isn't quite so regular, every other shot is
		a double one?
	* Bath: one guard repeatedly re-arrives but that seems to be a bug
		in the original
	* Bath: guards shooting eventually wear away the column
	* shots: wall damage not remembered if you return?
	* falling/grab: the falling after being kicked off the edge
	  is actually slightly different than the fall/grab animation
	  (both background and the animation).  We reuse stuff to
	  save space


FUTURE WORK:
============

* Intro
  + add Mockingboard music

* L1 pool
  + adjust tentacle to not go off edge of screen
  + adjust x position of tentacle grab

* l2 vent room
  + Make guard appear
