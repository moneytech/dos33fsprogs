+ Opening graphics (BASIC)
+ 80-column support
+ 40 column support
+ Electric Duet support?

Abandoned
+ compressed ascii art
	-- had issues with re-entrancy, decided to abandon
		fitting in 16k
+ six-channel support
	-- went for 4-channel support instead
+ lowecase for 40-column/speaker option?
	-- seems like too much complexity, people without 80-col
		cards will just have to with uppercase
