Apple II dSr Shapetable Party
-=DESiRE=-  / @party 2020

The Apple II does not have fancy graphics hardware, but it does have
software scalable vector routines in ROM.

Platform: Apple II
	Requires Apple II+ (1979) or later

Code:	deater

Website/video/more info:

	Special thanks to Will Winter for recording this for me
	as my Apple II hardware is still under lockdown

Files:
	DSRSHAPE  -- 251 byte executable
	dsr_shape.s -- source code, can assemble with ca65 assembler
	dsr_shape.dsk -- 140k Apple DOS33 disk image for use in emulator

Running:
	Type:
		BRUN DSRSHAPE
	at the basic prompt

Emulator:
	If you want to run in an emulator, I recommend AppleWin
	It runs fine under wine on Linux too.

Notes:
	+ 251 Byte demo for the Apple II (1MHz 6502)
	+ Written in 6502 assembly language
	+ Uses "high-resolution" graphics mode which is 280x192 in 6 colors.
	+ Depends on the Applesoft BASIC ROM for "HGR" and "XDRAW" routines
		which means it requires at least an Apple II+ (released in
		1979) or later machine.
		Should work on a II+/IIe/IIc/IIgs, and even an original
		Apple II (1977) if you have an Applesoft language card
		ROM expansion
	+ Can press any key at any time to exit
