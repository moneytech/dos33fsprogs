%c%VMW Chiptune Player

* Finally got a Mockingboard card

* Fit 30+ mins of chiptune YM5 music
  on a 140k floppy, 48k RAM

* Secret is LZ4 (thanks qkumba)
  Load compressed from disk
  Uncompress in chunks while playing  

* Still bothersome sound quality
  issues I have not resolved.

* Might be race condition, if so
  the emulators aren't being faithful.

* Drives me nuts
